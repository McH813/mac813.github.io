    <div class="post-content"><p>Note: First than everything, sorry the english, is not my native language and always learning new stuff about it.</p>
<p>I have always been thinking about writing a blog, but my mindset has always been the same &ldquo;me? a blog? what am I supposed to post! I can&rsquo;t even think anything I could share with people, I don&rsquo;t know nothing compared to the people
who blogs!&quot;, currently that mindset has been changing. In the same way, maybe I read a really entry-level article and at some moment and it was (or is) helpful for me, it also could be helpful for another person as well things faced, the issues I ran into, etc&hellip;, and being some sort of way of escape for me itself, I think this change of mindset is the result of my last 9 months living abroad.</p>
<p>I consider I started into IT being really old; with 18 I got my first Linux Sysadmin Job while with 9-12 years some children were playing with code, trying to break stuff, etc.
So far in this aprox. 5 years, I meet really nice people (as also not), and make really really nice friends, and of course been learning quite a lot of stuff, but&hellip;there is something that since I started I been avoiding (Programming), and something I&rsquo;ve been looking forward to learning it but thinking I can&rsquo;t do it (Security), these two things have been chasing me for a longg longg time (at the point of making me feel a bit depressed).</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, it&rsquo;s been around 9 months since I moved abroad (arrived in the Netherlands at ends of Apr. 2019), of this 9 months I spend 6 months in bench, without a project to work it (yes, getting my salary, but being anxious as I&rsquo;m, makes you to feel some panic when you get a paid for not doing nothing, even if you are studying), in this months I had a lot of time to think about myself, my career, what I wanted to do in the future, do I like to be a DevOps &ldquo;for all my life&rdquo; (today is devops, tomorrow who knows being as how IT works, so is just for saying it in a way), so&hellip;I started to study/practice with the book &lsquo;How to Design Programs&rsquo; (HtDP), even feeling I&rsquo;m going slow looking backwards and comparing to now, I think even if I still haven&rsquo;t finished, it indeed has been allowing me to grow.
Now&hellip;great, but, what about security? Is still there, and I really would like to start doing stuff NOW (I&rsquo;m more a learn-by-doing person), and not wait until get all my way through a designing programs book, combined with my thoughts of &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do Sec. without coding/I can&rsquo;t even imagine being breaking stuff without deep understanding of data-types, algorithms&rdquo;, I was getting nowhere, so I decided to try to re-program that mindset of mine, that results in me exchanging words with friends about it, talking with people who are currently into sec, and so far was an excellent idea&hellip;thanks to that now I know coding is not needed (as in mandatory) but it helps a lot to at least being able to write scripts, understand the workflow of exploits and modify them, like other things, and&hellip;that&rsquo;s something I CAN DO (and have to experience in it).</p>
<p>Said that now my goal is to jump into the Sec. field, I started to play with boxes in HTB and reading some books, this has allowed me to set my first checkpoint: getting the OSCP cert, not for the cert itself, but more for the challenge and some compensation-ish for not having experience into sec.
Once getting the OSCP, I will come back to the HtDP to polish my programming skills (or why not, also try to keep it in parallel?), and keep climbing (I love rock climbing/bouldering, so I could use a lot of metaphors from it!) my way up to the tops, trying to not compare me with other people, enjoying the route, and learning from all my falls; a fight between me and me.</p>
<p>I will use this space to post walk-throughs in some HTB boxes, blog some thoughts once in a while (like this post itself), stuff in my path of also learning Dutch, etc.</p>
<p>So far so good, keep learning and never stop doing it.</p>
