      <description>Quick Summary Well, the last months I have been really away from doing write-ups, specifically due to being full focused on my OSCP which I still can&amp;rsquo;t belive I passed!! I did an extensive write up about my experience going through it, if you still haven&amp;rsquo;t read it you can click here to go to it
I have more machines to do a write-up of, for example some of them are Postman, Traverxec, Mango, SolidState, OpenAdmin, Chatter Box among others, but well&amp;hellip;I will try to do them as my time allows me hehe.</description>

      <description>Preface This is the story of how I got my OSCP coming from a background as Linux Sysadmin/DevOps as also which ones are my plans for the future.
Every tale where there is an adventurer, starts with him (the adventurer) and his friends, these who share the journey providing support and advice through it, as the story moves forward, new characters tend to appear, joining the adventurer in his travel.</description>

      <description>Hacking/OSCP Cheatsheet Well, just finished my 90 days journey of OSCP labs, so now here is my cheatsheet of it (and of hacking itself), I will be adding stuff in an incremental way as I go having time and/or learning new stuff. But this is basically the tools I tend to relie and use in this way the most. Hope is helpfull for you!
Enumeration Network discoverie Nmap I tend to run 3 nmaps, an initial one, a full one and an UDP one, all of them in parallel:</description>

      <description>Quick Summary Finally, I&amp;rsquo;m posting the walk-through of this box, currently, I&amp;rsquo;m preparing my OSCP so most of my free time goes dedicated to it :D. At the time I did this box, I was only documenting with screenshots, so some dates could differ between the write up below as I accessed now to get plain text to not overload this with screenshots.
This was a box where for the foothold, you needed to upload a .</description>

      <description>Quick Summary First than everything, I need to make clear that this box has 2 ways for doing privilege escalation: one is doing reversing and the other taking advantage of a misconfiguration with sudo and git. I will describe the steps for the sudo + git path as I&amp;rsquo;m just starting to do my first steps into more low-level stuff. Despite this, in the future I will actualize this post to reflect also the reversing path.</description>

      <description>Quick Summary So!! Today was just retired Craft from Hack the box, this was a really fun box to do, and also I felt pretty well doing it, because even if I needed some nudges, it was actually the first box I got to the foothold without hints (elsen if I needed some guidance with python, thanks a lot @Frundrod!!), and afterward to get user I was a bit lost and also needed some hints (was not realizing something I have literally in my nose, thankss a lot @Fugl!</description>

      <description>Note: First than everything, sorry the english, is not my native language and always learning new stuff about it.
I have always been thinking about writing a blog, but my mindset has always been the same &amp;ldquo;me? a blog? what am I supposed to post! I can&amp;rsquo;t even think anything I could share with people, I don&amp;rsquo;t know nothing compared to the people who blogs!&amp;quot;, currently that mindset has been changing.</description>
