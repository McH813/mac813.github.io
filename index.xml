      <description>Quick Summary Finally, I&amp;rsquo;m posting the walk-through of this box, currently, I&amp;rsquo;m preparing my OSCP so most of my free time goes dedicated to it :D. At the time I did this box, I was only documenting with screenshots, so some dates could differ between the write up below as I accessed now to get plain text to not overload this with screenshots.
This was a box where for the foothold, you needed to upload a .</description>

      <description>Quick Summary First than everything, I need to make clear that this box has 2 ways for doing privilege escalation: one is doing reversing and the other taking advantage of a misconfiguration with sudo and git. I will describe the steps for the sudo + git path as I&amp;rsquo;m just starting to do my first steps into more low-level stuff. Despite this, in the future I will actualize this post to reflect also the reversing path.</description>

      <description>Quick Summary So!! Today was just retired Craft from Hack the box, this was a really fun box to do, and also I felt pretty well doing it, because even if I needed some nudges, it was actually the first box I got to the foothold without hints (elsen if I needed some guidance with python, thanks a lot @Frundrod!!), and afterward to get user I was a bit lost and also needed some hints (was not realizing something I have literally in my nose, thankss a lot @Fugl!</description>

      <description>Note: First than everything, sorry the english, is not my native language and always learning new stuff about it.
I have always been thinking about writing a blog, but my mindset has always been the same &amp;ldquo;me? a blog? what am I supposed to post! I can&amp;rsquo;t even think anything I could share with people, I don&amp;rsquo;t know nothing compared to the people who blogs!&amp;quot;, currently that mindset has been changing.</description>
