      <description>Quick Summary First than everything, I need to make clear that this box has 2 ways for doing privilege escalation: one is doing reversing and the other taking advantage of a misconfiguration with sudo and git. I will describe the steps for the sudo + git path as I&amp;rsquo;m just starting to do my first steps into more low-level stuff. Despite this, in the future I will actualize this post to reflect also the reversing path.</description>

      <description>Quick Summary So!! Today was just retired Craft from Hack the box, this was a really fun box to do, and also I felt pretty well doing it, because even if I needed some nudges, it was actually the first box I got to the foothold without hints (elsen if I needed some guidance with python, thanks a lot @Frundrod!!), and afterward to get user I was a bit lost and also needed some hints (was not realizing something I have literally in my nose, thankss a lot @Fugl!</description>
